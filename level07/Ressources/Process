We see that we have an executable.
 so we `ltrace ./level07` and see that it does getegid and geteuid.
Which are getting id of the person and the group who own the file which is level07 (how fortunate !)
 and we see that it get the env variable "LOGNAME" does something important.
so we try and see that when we do : env LOGNAME="something" ./level07 it echoes "something" so we try with \`getflag\` with the backticks so that when it gets echoed it gets run and we get our token
