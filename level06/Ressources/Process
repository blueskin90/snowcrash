first we scp the php file so we can put a correct indentation for it to be more readable.

we see that the regex only accepts something like this in the file it reads from first argument: [x ... ] and we see /e wich interprets as the result of the function called in the regex

so we try something like : [x phpinfo()] and see that it displays it so we try something like : [x {${system(${z})}}] which will execute the second argument in a new terminal

then we do : ~/level06 ourfile getflag and we get : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub



We can see the php script use the deprecated and vunerable regex 'e' modifier
So the "/(\[x (.*)\])/e" regex will evaluate anything into the ".*" and call the 'y' function with it
We write an exploit file to match the regex above

[x ${`getflag`}]
