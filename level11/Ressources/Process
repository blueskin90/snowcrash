when we do ls we see a lua file which tells us a few things :

it listen on localhost 5151

and then concatenate whatever we send as a password with no treatment between an "echo " and a " | sha1sum"

so we send something like "lol | getflag > /tmp/flag" when we send it says erf nope but when we cat /tmp/flag we get the token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
