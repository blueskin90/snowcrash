first we start the program and it says : UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

when we objdump -d the executable we see that we do a getuid
so we use gdb with "gdb level13" then we do a : break getuid

when the break happens we do step, step, step, and see that after the third we get kicked out, so we start again, and do step twice and do a : info all-registers and see that "eax" has the value 2013 in it, so we do : set $eax = 4242 and then we do a step and we get our flag displayed !
