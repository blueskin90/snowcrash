we see that it runs on localhost:4646

and takes argument X and pass a few regex on it, first ones capitalize everything, the second one only get the part before first space

so we know how to make our request, since we know it capitalize everything and deletes everything after a space, we assume that no command with arguments will be working, so we know we have to execute a file, but the only part where we can create files is /tmp/ so we try to create a script in /tmp that does "getflag > /tmp/flag" and name it in full capital letters (like TEST)

unfortunately when we run the command with `/tmp/test` it doesnt work due to the fact that /TMP/ does not exists, so we try `/*/test` and it works !

so we go to encode it on meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder and we get : %60%2F*%2FTEST%60

so we curl "localhost:4646?x=%60%2F*%2FTEST%60" and when we cat /tmp/flag we get our flag !
